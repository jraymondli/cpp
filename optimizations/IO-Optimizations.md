In C++, `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` is a performance optimization technique used when you're mixing C++ standard input/output operations (like `std::cin`, `std::cout`) with C-style input/output functions (like `scanf`, `printf`). 

By default, the C++ standard streams (`std::cin`, `std::cout`, etc.) are synchronized with the C standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, etc.) to ensure consistent behavior. This allows you to freely mix C and C++ I/O operations without worrying about output being in the wrong order. However, this synchronization comes at a performance cost because it ensures compatibility between the two styles of I/O.

### What problem does it solve?
The primary problem it solves is the **performance overhead** caused by the default synchronization between C++ streams and C-style streams.

When you disable this synchronization using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, you tell the program that you won’t be mixing C and C++ I/O operations, allowing the C++ streams to operate independently, which improves performance, especially in competitive programming or scenarios involving heavy I/O.

### When to use it:
- **When performance matters** and you are using only C++ I/O functions (`std::cin`, `std::cout`), and not mixing them with C I/O (`scanf`, `printf`, etc.).
- **Avoid using it** if you plan to use both C and C++ I/O functions in the same program because disabling synchronization can cause unpredictable behavior.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);  // Disable synchronization with C-style I/O
    std::cin.tie(nullptr);             // Untie cin from cout for further performance gain

    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;  // Input from user
    std::cout << a + b << std::endl;  // Output the sum

    return 0;
}
```

### Benefits:
1. **Improved Performance**: Disabling synchronization can make `std::cin` and `std::cout` significantly faster (often 5-10 times faster in scenarios with a lot of I/O).
2. **Efficient for Competitive Programming**: Since input/output speed is often a bottleneck in competitive programming, using `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` is a common practice to avoid unnecessary slowdowns.

### Important Considerations:
- After calling `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)`, if you use both C++ I/O and C-style I/O in the same program, the order of output might become unpredictable.
- `std::cin.tie(nullptr)` can be used along with it to untie `std::cin` from `std::cout`, preventing automatic flushing of the output buffer, which can further improve performance when you only need to flush at specific points.

In summary, `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false)` is useful when you want to make I/O more efficient, but should only be used when you are confident that you won’t mix C-style and C++-style I/O operations.
