### Introduction to Design Patterns in C++

Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common software design problems. They are not finished pieces of code, but templates that help solve issues in a particular context. In C++, design patterns are especially powerful as they allow you to tackle issues related to performance, resource management, and modularity.

Design patterns can be grouped into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with object interaction and communication.

Letâ€™s explore some of the common design patterns in C++ with examples.

### 1. **Singleton Pattern (Creational Pattern)**

**Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to that instance.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    static std::mutex mutex_;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    Singleton() {}

public:
    // Static method to access the single instance
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    void showMessage() {
        std::cout << "Singleton Instance: Hello World!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize static members
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
std::mutex Singleton::mutex_;

int main() {
    Singleton* s = Singleton::getInstance();
    s->showMessage();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **Private constructor**: Prevents creating objects from outside the class.
- **Static method**: Provides global access to the instance.
- **Thread safety**: The `std::mutex` ensures the singleton instance is created in a thread-safe manner.

---

### 2. **Factory Pattern (Creational Pattern)**

**Purpose**: Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Product interface
class Product {
public:
    virtual void use() = 0;
};

// Concrete product A
class ConcreteProductA : public Product {
public:
    void use() override {
        std::cout << "Using ConcreteProductA" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Concrete product B
class ConcreteProductB : public Product {
public:
    void use() override {
        std::cout << "Using ConcreteProductB" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Factory
class ProductFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Product> createProduct(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "A") {
            return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductA>();
        } else if (type == "B") {
            return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductB>();
        } else {
            return nullptr;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    auto product = ProductFactory::createProduct("A");
    if (product) product->use();

    product = ProductFactory::createProduct("B");
    if (product) product->use();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- The **factory method** allows creating objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
- The **client code** is decoupled from the concrete class it uses.
- The factory method returns a **base class pointer** (`Product`), while the concrete classes (`ConcreteProductA`, `ConcreteProductB`) implement specific behavior.

---

### 3. **Observer Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)**

**Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Observer Interface
class Observer {
public:
    virtual void update(const std::string& message) = 0;
};

// Concrete Observer
class ConcreteObserver : public Observer {
private:
    std::string name;
public:
    ConcreteObserver(const std::string& name) : name(name) {}
    void update(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << name << " received update: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

// Subject (Observable)
class Subject {
private:
    std::vector<Observer*> observers;
    std::string message;
public:
    void addObserver(Observer* observer) {
        observers.push_back(observer);
    }

    void removeObserver(Observer* observer) {
        observers.erase(std::remove(observers.begin(), observers.end(), observer), observers.end());
    }

    void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer* observer : observers) {
            observer->update(message);
        }
    }

    void setMessage(const std::string& message) {
        this->message = message;
        notifyObservers();
    }
};

int main() {
    Subject subject;

    ConcreteObserver observer1("Observer 1");
    ConcreteObserver observer2("Observer 2");

    subject.addObserver(&observer1);
    subject.addObserver(&observer2);

    subject.setMessage("Hello Observers!");
    subject.setMessage("Another message!");

    return 0;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **Observers** register with the **Subject** (the observable).
- When the state of the subject changes, all registered observers are notified using the `update()` method.
- This pattern is useful for implementing systems where a change in one object should trigger updates in others (e.g., GUIs, event-driven systems).

---

### 4. **Strategy Pattern (Behavioral Pattern)**

**Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Strategy Interface
class Strategy {
public:
    virtual void execute() = 0;
};

// Concrete Strategies
class ConcreteStrategyA : public Strategy {
public:
    void execute() override {
        std::cout << "Executing Strategy A" << std::endl;
    }
};

class ConcreteStrategyB : public Strategy {
public:
    void execute() override {
        std::cout << "Executing Strategy B" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Context
class Context {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<Strategy> strategy;
public:
    void setStrategy(std::unique_ptr<Strategy> s) {
        strategy = std::move(s);
    }

    void executeStrategy() {
        strategy->execute();
    }
};

int main() {
    Context context;

    context.setStrategy(std::make_unique<ConcreteStrategyA>());
    context.executeStrategy();  // Outputs: Executing Strategy A

    context.setStrategy(std::make_unique<ConcreteStrategyB>());
    context.executeStrategy();  // Outputs: Executing Strategy B

    return 0;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- The **context** holds a reference to a **strategy** and delegates the execution of behavior to it.
- The **strategy** can be changed at runtime, allowing flexible and interchangeable algorithms.
- This pattern is useful in systems where different methods are required to perform a task based on different conditions (e.g., payment strategies, sorting algorithms).

---

### 5. **Decorator Pattern (Structural Pattern)**

**Purpose**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

// Component Interface
class Coffee {
public:
    virtual std::string getDescription() const = 0;
    virtual double cost() const = 0;
    virtual ~Coffee() = default;
};

// Concrete Component
class SimpleCoffee : public Coffee {
public:
    std::string getDescription() const override {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    double cost() const override {
        return 5.0;
    }
};

// Base Decorator
class CoffeeDecorator : public Coffee {
protected:
    std::unique_ptr<Coffee> coffee;
public:
    CoffeeDecorator(std::unique_ptr<Coffee> c) : coffee(std::move(c)) {}
};

// Concrete Decorators
class Milk : public CoffeeDecorator {
public:
    Milk(std::unique_ptr<Coffee> c) : CoffeeDecorator(std::move(c)) {}

    std::string getDescription() const override {
        return coffee->getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    double cost() const override {
        return coffee->cost() + 1.5;
    }
};

class Sugar : public CoffeeDecorator {
public:
    Sugar(std::unique_ptr<Coffee> c) : CoffeeDecorator(std::move(c)) {}

    std::string getDescription() const override {
        return coffee->getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    double cost() const override {
        return coffee->cost() + 0.5;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::unique_ptr<Coffee> myCoffee = std::make_unique<SimpleCoffee>();
    myCoffee = std::make_unique<Milk>(std::move(myCoffee));
    myCoffee = std::make_unique<Sugar>(std::move(myCoffee));

    std::cout << myCoffee->getDescription() << " costs $" << myCoffee->cost() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Key Points:
- The **decorator** dynamically adds responsibilities (like `Milk` or `Sugar`) to the **component** (`SimpleCoffee`).
- This pattern provides a flexible and extensible way to add functionality without modifying the original class.

| **Prototype**              | Creational     | Creates new objects by copying existing ones (cloning).                                          | Cloning objects when object creation is expensive               |
| **Adapter**                | Structural     | Converts an interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.                     | Adapting legacy systems to new interfaces                       |
| **Bridge**                 | Structural     | Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.            | GUI frameworks, cross-platform graphics interfaces              |
| **Decorator**              | Structural     | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.                                   | Adding features to objects like Coffee with Milk/Sugar          |
| **Facade**                 | Structural     | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.                                          | Simplifying usage of complex libraries like graphics subsystems |
| **Proxy**                  | Structural     | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                   | Remote objects, virtual proxies (lazy loading)                  |
| **Composite**              | Structural     | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.                        | UI elements (windows, buttons), file systems                    |
| **Flyweight**              | Structural     | Minimizes memory usage by sharing data with similar objects.                                      | Managing large numbers of objects like characters in a text editor |
| **Strategy**               | Behavioral     | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them, and makes them interchangeable.                | Sorting algorithms, payment processing                          |
| **Observer**               | Behavioral     | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. | Event-driven systems, GUI applications                          |
| **Command**                | Behavioral     | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests. | Undo/Redo functionality, GUI commands                           |
| **State**                  | Behavioral     | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.                           | Vending machines, state machines                                |

| **Iterator**               | Behavioral     | Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing the underlying representation. | Traversing collections like lists or arrays                     |
| **Mediator**               | Behavioral     | Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.                                | Chat rooms, GUI component interaction                           |
| **Memento**                | Behavioral     | Captures an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later. | Undo functionality in text editors, state saving                |
| **Chain of Responsibility**| Behavioral     | Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles the request.                 | Logging systems, event handling                                 |
| **Visitor**                | Behavioral     | Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the objects. | Operations on composite structures (e.g., file systems)         |
| **Interpreter**            | Behavioral     | Defines a representation for a grammar and an interpreter to process sentences in that grammar.   | Parsing languages, calculators                                  |

### Summary:
- **Creational Patterns** focus on the efficient creation of objects, minimizing complexity in the instantiation process.
- **Structural Patterns** deal with the composition of classes and objects, ensuring that different components can work together.
- **Behavioral Patterns** focus on communication and interaction between objects to achieve specific tasks. 

These design patterns are templates for solving common software design problems in an elegant and reusable manner. Each pattern provides a structure that can be adapted to suit specific software requirements.
