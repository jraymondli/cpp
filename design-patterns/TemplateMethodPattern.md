The **Template Method Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. It promotes code reuse and can help manage complex algorithms.

### Key Components
- **Abstract Class**: Contains the template method, which defines the sequence of steps for an algorithm. It may also define abstract methods for subclasses to implement.
- **Concrete Class**: Subclasses that implement the abstract methods and provide specific behavior for the steps in the algorithm.

### Example: Data Processing Pipeline

In this example, we will create a simple data processing pipeline that consists of two types of data processing: **CSV processing** and **XML processing**. Both types of processing share a common structure but have different implementations for specific steps.

#### Code Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Abstract Class
class DataProcessor {
public:
    // Template Method
    void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

protected:
    virtual void readData() = 0;   // Step to read data (abstract)
    virtual void processData() = 0; // Step to process data (abstract)
    virtual void writeData() = 0;   // Step to write data (abstract)
};

// Concrete Class for CSV Processing
class CSVProcessor : public DataProcessor {
protected:
    void readData() override {
        std::cout << "Reading data from CSV file." << std::endl;
    }

    void processData() override {
        std::cout << "Processing CSV data." << std::endl;
    }

    void writeData() override {
        std::cout << "Writing data to CSV file." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Concrete Class for XML Processing
class XMLProcessor : public DataProcessor {
protected:
    void readData() override {
        std::cout << "Reading data from XML file." << std::endl;
    }

    void processData() override {
        std::cout << "Processing XML data." << std::endl;
    }

    void writeData() override {
        std::cout << "Writing data to XML file." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Client code
int main() {
    DataProcessor* csvProcessor = new CSVProcessor();
    csvProcessor->process();  // Process CSV data

    std::cout << std::endl;   // Print a newline for separation

    DataProcessor* xmlProcessor = new XMLProcessor();
    xmlProcessor->process();  // Process XML data

    // Clean up
    delete csvProcessor;
    delete xmlProcessor;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Abstract Class (`DataProcessor`)**: Defines the template method `process()`, which outlines the sequence of operations (`readData()`, `processData()`, and `writeData()`). The methods are defined as abstract, so they must be implemented by subclasses.
2. **Concrete Classes**:
   - **CSVProcessor**: Implements the steps for reading, processing, and writing CSV data.
   - **XMLProcessor**: Implements the steps for reading, processing, and writing XML data.
3. **Client**: In the client code, instances of `CSVProcessor` and `XMLProcessor` are created, and their `process()` method is called, which executes the defined steps in the correct order.

### Example 2: Game Development

In this example, we will implement a simple game where different types of games (e.g., `Chess` and `Checkers`) follow the same sequence of game setup but have different implementations for specific setup steps.

#### Code Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Abstract Class
class Game {
public:
    // Template Method
    void play() {
        initializeGame();
        startPlay();
        endPlay();
    }

protected:
    virtual void initializeGame() = 0; // Step to initialize the game (abstract)
    virtual void startPlay() = 0;       // Step to start the game (abstract)
    virtual void endPlay() = 0;         // Step to end the game (abstract)
};

// Concrete Class for Chess
class Chess : public Game {
protected:
    void initializeGame() override {
        std::cout << "Initializing Chess Game." << std::endl;
    }

    void startPlay() override {
        std::cout << "Starting Chess Game." << std::endl;
    }

    void endPlay() override {
        std::cout << "Ending Chess Game." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Concrete Class for Checkers
class Checkers : public Game {
protected:
    void initializeGame() override {
        std::cout << "Initializing Checkers Game." << std::endl;
    }

    void startPlay() override {
        std::cout << "Starting Checkers Game." << std::endl;
    }

    void endPlay() override {
        std::cout << "Ending Checkers Game." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Client code
int main() {
    Game* chessGame = new Chess();
    chessGame->play(); // Play Chess game

    std::cout << std::endl; // Print a newline for separation

    Game* checkersGame = new Checkers();
    checkersGame->play(); // Play Checkers game

    // Clean up
    delete chessGame;
    delete checkersGame;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Abstract Class (`Game`)**: Defines the template method `play()`, which outlines the sequence of operations for playing a game (`initializeGame()`, `startPlay()`, and `endPlay()`). The methods are abstract, requiring subclasses to implement them.
2. **Concrete Classes**:
   - **Chess**: Implements the steps for initializing, starting, and ending a chess game.
   - **Checkers**: Implements the steps for initializing, starting, and ending a checkers game.
3. **Client**: In the client code, instances of `Chess` and `Checkers` are created, and their `play()` method is called, which executes the defined steps in the correct order.

### Key Points
- The **Template Method Pattern** promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses to customize specific steps of an algorithm while maintaining the overall structure.
- It helps manage complex algorithms by separating the fixed parts from the variable parts.
- This pattern is useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms share a common structure but differ in specific implementations.
