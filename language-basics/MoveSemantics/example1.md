```

In the provided C++ code, the line:

```cpp
vec.push_back(std::move(str));
```

uses **`std::move`** to explicitly move the contents of `str` into the vector. This avoids an unnecessary copy, which is the key difference from simply doing `vec.push_back(str)`.

Let’s break it down:

### Without `std::move`:
If you remove `std::move` and simply write:
```cpp
vec.push_back(str);
```
the following happens:
- **Copying**: The `push_back` call will copy the string `str` into the vector. Since `str` still holds the value `"Hello"`, the contents will remain intact after the operation. In this case, `"Hello"` would be copied into the vector as the third element.
- **Extra Memory Use**: This copying involves allocating new memory for the third element in the vector and copying the characters from `str` into the new location.
- **No Optimization**: The string `str` will still be available for further use, but there’s no need for `str` after the insertion, so copying it is less efficient than moving it, especially for larger strings.

### With `std::move`:
When you use `std::move(str)`, you are indicating that `str` can be "moved from." This means:
- **Move Semantics**: Instead of copying `str`, the string contents will be **moved** into the vector. Specifically, the internal memory of `str` will be transferred to the new element in the vector, and `str` will be left in a valid but empty (or unspecified) state.
- **No Copying**: Moving avoids the costly operation of copying each character from `str` into the vector, making it more efficient.
- **`str` After `std::move`**: After the move, `str` will be in an empty or invalid state, meaning you should not rely on its contents. Accessing `str` after the move would not provide meaningful data, as it is now "empty."

### Consequence of Not Using `std::move`:
If you do not use `std::move`:
- **Less Efficient**: The `push_back(str)` would copy the string instead of moving it. This results in an unnecessary copy operation and higher memory use, especially when dealing with large strings or complex objects.
- **No Impact on Correctness**: The program will still work correctly, but it will be less efficient in terms of performance due to the extra copy.
  
In this case, using `std::move(str)` optimizes performance because `str` is no longer needed after this point. By moving it, you avoid a costly copy operation.

### Example:
Here’s a simplified representation of the differences:

#### Without `std::move`:
```cpp
std::string str = "Hello";
vec.push_back(str);  // Copies "Hello" into the vector
// str is still "Hello"
```

#### With `std::move`:
```cpp
std::string str = "Hello";
vec.push_back(std::move(str));  // Moves "Hello" into the vector
// str is now empty or in an unspecified state
```

Using **`std::move`** is especially important for performance when dealing with large objects like strings or containers, where copying can be costly.
