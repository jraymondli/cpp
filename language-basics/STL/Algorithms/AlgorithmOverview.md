STL algorithms offer a wide range of functions to perform common operations on data (mainly containers). These functions implement the most efficient version of the algorithm for tasks such as sorting, searching, modifying and manipulating data in containers, etc. All STL algorithms are defined inside the <algorithm> and <numeric> header file.
There is no formal classification of STL algorithms, but we can group them into two types based on the type of operations they perform:


## Manipulative Algorithms

performs operations that modifies the elements of the given container or rearrange their order

* copy
* fill
* transform
* [replace](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdreplace-stdreplace_if-c/)
* [swap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-in-cpp/)
* [reverse](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdreverse-in-c/)
* [rotate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rotate-in-cpp-stl/)
* [remove](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdremove-stdremove_if-c/)
* unique

## Non-Manipulative Algorithms
