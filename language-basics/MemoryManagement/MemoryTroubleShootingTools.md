A **dangling pointer** in C++ refers to a pointer that continues to point to a memory location even after the memory it points to has been deallocated or freed. Accessing or dereferencing a dangling pointer leads to **undefined behavior**, which can cause crashes, memory corruption, or other unpredictable behavior in the program.

### Common Causes of Dangling Pointers:
1. **Deallocating Memory:** A pointer that points to dynamically allocated memory may become a dangling pointer if the memory is deallocated (freed) but the pointer is not set to `nullptr`.
2. **Returning Pointers to Local Variables:** Returning the address of a local variable from a function causes the pointer to become invalid when the function ends, because the local variable is destroyed.
3. **Use-after-free:** Continuing to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed.

### Example of Dangling Pointer

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void createDanglingPointer() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);  // Dynamically allocate memory and assign it to ptr
    std::cout << "Value before deleting: " << *ptr << std::endl;

    delete ptr;  // Free the allocated memory

    // ptr is now a dangling pointer, as the memory it points to has been deallocated
    std::cout << "Trying to access the dangling pointer: " << *ptr << std::endl;  // Undefined behavior
}

int main() {
    createDanglingPointer();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Memory Allocation:**
   - `int* ptr = new int(10);` dynamically allocates memory for an `int` and initializes it with the value `10`. `ptr` points to this allocated memory.

2. **Deleting the Memory:**
   - `delete ptr;` deallocates the memory that `ptr` points to. After this point, `ptr` becomes a **dangling pointer** because it still holds the address of the deallocated memory, but the memory is no longer valid.

3. **Dereferencing the Dangling Pointer:**
   - `*ptr` tries to access the memory that was just deallocated. This leads to **undefined behavior**, which could result in a crash or garbage output.

### Example Output (Undefined Behavior):
- In some cases, you may see the original value (`10`), or the program might crash, depending on the system and compiler. The output is unpredictable because the memory is no longer valid.

### Fixing Dangling Pointers:
1. After deallocating memory using `delete`, set the pointer to `nullptr`:
   ```cpp
   delete ptr;
   ptr = nullptr;  // Now ptr doesn't point to any invalid memory
   ```
   - Now, trying to dereference `nullptr` will result in a more predictable error (null pointer dereference), which is easier to handle or detect.

### Conclusion:
A dangling pointer is a serious issue that occurs when a pointer points to memory that has been freed or deallocated. To avoid dangling pointers, you should carefully manage the lifecycle of dynamically allocated memory and ensure that pointers are set to `nullptr` after memory is deallocated.
