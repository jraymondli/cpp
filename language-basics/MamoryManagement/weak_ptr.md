A **`std::weak_ptr`** in C++ is a smart pointer that provides a non-owning, weak reference to an object managed by a `std::shared_ptr`. It is useful for avoiding **cyclic dependencies** that can lead to memory leaks in programs using `std::shared_ptr`.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Non-owning reference:**
   - Unlike `std::shared_ptr`, which shares ownership of the object, `std::weak_ptr` does not contribute to the reference count of the object.
   - It simply "observes" the object managed by a `std::shared_ptr` without keeping it alive.

2. **Avoiding Cyclic Dependencies:**
   - In cases where two or more objects refer to each other through `std::shared_ptr`, a cyclic dependency can occur. This causes memory to never be freed, because each object holds a reference to the other, preventing their reference counts from ever reaching zero.
   - `std::weak_ptr` solves this problem by allowing one of the references to be "weak", breaking the ownership cycle.

3. **Expiration and Use:**
   - A `std::weak_ptr` can be used to check if the object it points to still exists (i.e., if the `std::shared_ptr` is still managing the object) by using the `expired()` method.
   - To access the managed object, `std::weak_ptr` must first be converted to a `std::shared_ptr` using `lock()`. If the object has already been deleted, `lock()` will return a null pointer.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class B;

class A {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<B> b_ptr;
    ~A() { std::cout << "A destroyed\n"; }
};

class B {
public:
    std::weak_ptr<A> a_ptr;  // Using weak_ptr to prevent cyclic dependency
    ~B() { std::cout << "B destroyed\n"; }
};

int main() {
    auto a = std::make_shared<A>();
    auto b = std::make_shared<B>();
    
    a->b_ptr = b;
    b->a_ptr = a;  // weak_ptr prevents cyclic reference here

    std::cout << "End of main\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- In this example, class `A` holds a `std::shared_ptr` to `B`, and `B` holds a `std::weak_ptr` to `A`.
- Without `std::weak_ptr`, if both used `std::shared_ptr`, their destructors would never be called because each object would keep the other alive through shared ownership.
- By using `std::weak_ptr`, we break the cycle since it does not contribute to the reference count of `A`.

### Key Methods in `std::weak_ptr`:
1. **`lock()`**: Converts `std::weak_ptr` to `std::shared_ptr` if the object still exists. If the object has been destroyed, it returns an empty `std::shared_ptr`.
2. **`expired()`**: Returns `true` if the managed object has already been destroyed (i.e., if there are no remaining `std::shared_ptr` instances holding it).
3. **`reset()`**: Resets the `std::weak_ptr`, releasing the reference to the managed object.

### Use Case Scenarios:
- **Observer Pattern**: A `std::weak_ptr` can be used to observe an object without affecting its lifecycle.
- **Cyclic Dependencies**: Preventing memory leaks in data structures like graphs or trees where nodes may refer to each other in a cycle.
- **Cache Management**: A cache can hold `std::weak_ptr` references to objects, allowing them to be garbage collected when not used elsewhere.
