In C++, the `override` keyword is used to explicitly indicate that a member function is meant to override a virtual function in a base class. This keyword was introduced in C++11 to enhance code clarity and catch potential errors at compile time.

### Why Use `override`?
- **Type Safety**: It ensures that a function is actually overriding a virtual function in a base class. If there's a mismatch (e.g., due to a typo or incorrect signature), the compiler will throw an error.
- **Improved Readability**: It makes it clear to readers of the code that the function is meant to override a base class function, rather than simply being a new method in the derived class.

### Basic Example of `override`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() const {
        std::cout << "Base class display function\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() const override {  // Correctly overrides the Base class method
        std::cout << "Derived class display function\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr = new Derived();
    basePtr->display();  // Calls the Derived class method

    delete basePtr;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- In the above code, `Base::display` is a `virtual` function, which means it is intended to be overridden by derived classes.
- In the `Derived` class, we use `override` to explicitly indicate that `Derived::display` is overriding `Base::display`. 
- When the function is called through a `Base*` pointer, the `Derived` class version is invoked (thanks to polymorphism).

### Benefits of `override`

1. **Compile-Time Error Detection**:
   If you make a mistake while trying to override a function (e.g., incorrect function signature), the compiler will catch it.

   Example with error:
   ```cpp
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void display(int x) override {  // ERROR! Not overriding anything
           std::cout << "Wrong override\n";
       }
   };
   ```

   This will result in a compile-time error because the function signature in the derived class doesn't match the `display` function in the base class.

2. **Prevents Accidental Method Hiding**:
   Without `override`, if a derived class defines a method with the same name but different parameters, it will hide the base class method instead of overriding it. `override` prevents such accidents.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual void print() const {
           std::cout << "Base print\n";
       }
   };

   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void print(int x) const override {  // ERROR! Not overriding, different signature
           std::cout << "Derived print\n";
       }
   };
   ```

   The `Derived::print` method does not match the signature of `Base::print`, so without `override`, it would hide the base class method. But with `override`, the compiler catches the mistake and throws an error.

### Using `override` with Inheritance

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() const {
        std::cout << "Animal sound\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() const override {  // Overrides Animal::speak
        std::cout << "Woof\n";
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() const override {  // Overrides Animal::speak
        std::cout << "Meow\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a1 = new Dog();
    Animal* a2 = new Cat();

    a1->speak();  // Output: Woof
    a2->speak();  // Output: Meow

    delete a1;
    delete a2;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- `Dog::speak` and `Cat::speak` both override the virtual function `Animal::speak`. Using `override` ensures that they match the base class signature and prevents mistakes.
- The correct version of `speak` is called based on the object type (`Dog` or `Cat`), even though the function is called through a pointer to the base class (`Animal*`).

### `final` Keyword with `override`

The `final` keyword can be used in conjunction with `override` to indicate that a virtual function cannot be overridden further in derived classes.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() const {
        std::cout << "Base show\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() const override final {  // Cannot be overridden further
        std::cout << "Derived show\n";
    }
};

class MoreDerived : public Derived {
public:
    // void show() const override {   // ERROR! Cannot override a final method
    //     std::cout << "MoreDerived show\n";
    // }
};
```

In this example, `Derived::show` is marked `final`, which prevents any further overrides in classes derived from `Derived`. If `MoreDerived` tries to override `show`, the compiler will throw an error.

### Summary of `override`:
- `override` is used to **explicitly indicate** that a function is overriding a virtual function from the base class.
- It helps with **compile-time error detection** by ensuring the function signatures match between the base and derived classes.
- It improves **code clarity** by making the overriding behavior explicit.
- It works together with `final` to prevent further overriding of a function in derived classes.
