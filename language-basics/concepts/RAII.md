**RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** is a core concept in C++ used to manage resources like memory, file handles, network connections, etc. It ties the lifecycle of resources to the lifetime of objects, ensuring that resources are acquired during object creation and automatically released during object destruction.

### Key Points:
1. **Resource Management via Objects:**
   - When a resource is acquired (e.g., memory allocation, file opening), it is bound to an object's lifetime.
   - When the object goes out of scope (i.e., when it is destroyed), the resource is automatically released (e.g., memory is freed, file is closed).
   
2. **Constructors for Acquisition:**
   - The resource acquisition happens in the object's constructor. For instance, when you allocate dynamic memory or open a file, the constructor handles it.
   
3. **Destructors for Release:**
   - The object's destructor automatically releases the resource. In C++, destructors are called automatically when objects go out of scope or are explicitly deleted, ensuring proper cleanup.

### Example:
Consider a class that manages a file handle:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

class FileHandler {
public:
    FileHandler(const std::string& filename) {
        file.open(filename);
        if (!file.is_open()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("File could not be opened.");
        }
    }

    ~FileHandler() {
        if (file.is_open()) {
            file.close();
        }
    }

    // other member functions

private:
    std::fstream file;
};

int main() {
    try {
        FileHandler fileHandler("example.txt");
        // File is automatically closed when fileHandler goes out of scope
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Benefits:
1. **Exception Safety:** 
   - In case of an exception, destructors are still called as part of stack unwinding, ensuring resource deallocation even in error scenarios.
   
2. **Simpler Code:** 
   - You donâ€™t need to manually manage resource deallocation (e.g., no need for explicit `delete`, `close`, or `free` calls).
   
3. **Avoids Memory Leaks:** 
   - Automatic cleanup helps prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

### Typical Use Cases:
- **Smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)** in modern C++ use RAII to manage dynamic memory.
- **File, socket, and database connection management** use RAII to ensure proper resource release.
